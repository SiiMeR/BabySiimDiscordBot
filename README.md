# BabySiimDiscordBot

A discord bot written using the Discord.Net framework. 

The `AccessToken` field in the `appsettings.json` file is not included for security reasons so you will need to add it yourself.

Dependencies you need to download yourself and place in the `lib` folder:
* ffmpeg.exe
* libsodium.dll
* opus.dll

The bot searches for audio files to play from the `audio` folder.
